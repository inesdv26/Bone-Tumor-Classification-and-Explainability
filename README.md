# Uncertainty in Bone Tumor Classification: Enchondroma vs. Atypical Cartilaginous Tumor

## Overview

This repository contains the official manuscript and a Jupyter Notebook for my master's thesis, focused on distinguishing Enchondroma and Atypical Cartilaginous Tumor (ACT) using conventional radiographs.

## Contents

- manuscript.pdf: The complete written thesis, including research background, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- Uncertainty-in-Bone-Tumor-Classification.ipynb: A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating data processing, model development, inference, and explainability techniques.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to leverage a Deep Learning model to classify two types of bone tumor lesions that appear similar on X-ray images. The study uses Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to improve model interpretability and identify the most critical features contributing to predictions.

## How to Use

1. Read through the manuscript.pdf to get a comprehensive understanding of the research.
2. Explore the notebook for detailed code, analysis, and visualizations.

## Requirements

Install dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
