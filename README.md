# Uncertainty in Bone Tumor Classification: Enchondroma vs. Atypical Cartilaginous Tumor

# Overview

This repository contains the official manuscript and one Jupyter Notebook for my master's thesis project, which focuses on distinguishing between Enchondroma and Atypical Cartilaginous Tumor (ACT) from conventional radiographs using a Deep Learning model. 
The study also employs Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to enhance model interpretability and assess the contribution of individual pixels to the modelâ€™s prediction.
